# NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below. This dataset contains information about NYC public schools and their SAT performance.

## Key Questions

1. **What is the distribution of SAT scores across NYC public schools?**
   - Analyze how scores are spread out in each section (reading, math, writing) and the overall total score.

2. **Which NYC boroughs have the highest and lowest average SAT scores?**
   - Compare the average scores across different boroughs to identify geographic performance trends.

3. **How do the average SAT scores in reading, math, and writing vary across schools?**
   - Explore differences between schools in each section of the SAT to see if certain schools excel in specific areas.

4. **What percentage of NYC public schools meet or exceed an average total SAT score of 1200?**
   - Assess how many schools reach a benchmark score that might be relevant for college admissions.

5. **Which schools consistently perform in the top 10% across all sections of the SAT?**
   - Identify high-performing schools that excel in reading, math, and writing.

6. **Are there any significant trends in SAT performance over time, if multiple years of data are available?**
   - Investigate whether SAT scores in NYC public schools are improving or declining.

7. **How do socioeconomic factors, such as student eligibility for free or reduced lunch, correlate with SAT performance?**
   - Analyze whether there is a relationship between studentsâ€™ economic backgrounds and their SAT scores.

8. **Do school size and student-teacher ratio have an impact on SAT performance?**
   - Examine if larger schools or schools with different student-teacher ratios have better or worse SAT results.

9. **Is there a performance gap between male and female students in SAT scores?**
   - Look into whether there are any significant differences in performance between genders across the three sections of the SAT.

10. **What recommendations can be made to improve SAT performance in underperforming schools?**
    - Based on the analysis, propose actionable steps or interventions for schools that consistently underperform in SAT results.
