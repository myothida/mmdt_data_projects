# NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below. This dataset contains information about NYC public schools and their SAT performance.

## Data Camp Questions
1. Which NYC schools have the best math results? 
2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores? 
3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

------------------------------------------------

## Main Business Question
How do the SAT scores for NYC public schools vary by borough, and what insights can be drawn from the percentage of students tested to inform stakeholders?

## Analytical Questions
**SAT scores Analysis**: Focuses on analyzing the scores in different sectors : math, reading and writing. 
1. What is the average for each subject area in New York City?
2. WWhat is the distribution of SAT scores (mean, median, and range) across all boroughs for each subject area (math, reading, writing)?
3. How many schools fall into the high-performance category (defined as schools with an average SAT score above 80% of the maximum possible score, i.e., above 640 in each subject)?
4. What is the average percent tested for each borough, and how does it correlate with average SAT scores across math, reading, and writing?
5. Are there significant differences in the percent tested among schools categorized by their performance levels (high-perforamnce, low-performance)? 

**Comparison across Boroughs**: Focus on understanding the differences in SAT scores among various schools, which could help identify which schools are performing well and which are struggling.
1. Which borough has the highest average SAT scores in each subject area?
2. What are the top-performing and lowest-performing schools in each borough based on SAT scores?
3. How does the variability of SAT scores (standard deviation) differ across boroughs for each subject area?
4. Is there a correlation between the percent tested and average SAT scores at the borough level, and does this vary across boroughs?
5. How do schools categorized as high-performing compare to those categorized as low-performing in terms of the average percent tested in each borough?


## Getting Started

To begin analyzing the dataset, download `schools.csv` and load it into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Python with pandas, R, etc.). Follow the key questions to guide your analysis and draw insights from the data.
