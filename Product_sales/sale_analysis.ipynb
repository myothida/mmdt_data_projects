Since we do not have information about the product type, imputing missing values using the mean or median is not feasible, as it could oversimplify the data. Additionally, with only `1,074` `NaN` values (`544` out of `7,466` for the `email` method, `349` out of `4,982` for the `call` method, and `181` out of `2,572` for `email+call` method), I decided to remove the rows where revenue is missing, as this approach will not significantly impact the dataset size.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   - **Outliers:** Checking the number of years as cusomers, it shows that there are 2 customers with 47 and 63. Since Pens and Printers was founded only in 1984, the maximum years of the customers can not be more than `40`. Hence, both numbers are replaced with `40`. \n",

    "#### 7. Proposed Metric for Business Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric**: Revenue Per Customer (RPC) by Sales Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**: This metric calculates the average revenue generated by each customer for each sales method. It helps evaluate the profitability and effectiveness of different sales strategies (e.g., Email-only, Call-only, and Email + Call) by measuring how much revenue each customer brings in on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Business Should Use the Metric to Monitor the Business Problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Track Sales Effectiveness**: By calculating RPC for each sales method, the business can identify which method provides the highest return per customer. For instance, if the RPC for the Email + Call combination is significantly higher than that of other methods, the business can prioritize or optimize this method.\n",
    "- **Assess Profitability**: RPC allows the business to evaluate the profitability of each customer segment depending on the sales method. If one method yields a higher RPC, it suggests that customers engaged through this method are more valuable, justifying further investment in optimizing or scaling that method.\n",
    "- **Evaluate Growth Strategies**: If the business is targeting regions or customer segments with lower RPC, they can design tailored strategies to increase the revenue per customer in these areas. For example, if North Dakota shows a higher RPC but has a smaller customer base, efforts could be focused on expanding this customer base to further increase revenue.\n",
    "- **Monitor Long-Term Trends**: By tracking RPC over time, businesses can identify shifts in customer behavior. If the RPC decreases, it may indicate that customer engagement is declining, or the business may need to refine its sales strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimate Initial Value(s) for the Metric Based on Current Data**:\n",
    "- RPC (Email + Call) = 183.65\n",
    "- RPC (Email-only) = 97.13\n",
    "- RPC (Call-only) = 47.60\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights and Actionable Recommendations**:\n",
    "- **Highest RPC**: The Email + Call combination method has the highest revenue per customer, making it the most profitable engagement method.\n",
    "- **Targeted Strategy**: The business should focus on increasing the customer base for the Email + Call method, as it shows higher profitability compared to the other methods.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: While the Email-only and Call-only methods generate significant revenue, the Email + Call method has the highest potential for profitability per customer. Efforts should be made to scale this method through marketing campaigns or by refining the process.\n",
